# My Token

This is a solidity program to mint and burn the token.This program is developed to learn the basics of solidity.
## Description

This is a Solidity contract, which is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions: “mint” and “burn”. The “mint” function creates a new token for a specific user, while the “burn” function destroys the token of the user who performs this action.
## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., myToken.sol). Copy and paste the code from [myToken](myToken.sol)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "myToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the different functions present in it.
